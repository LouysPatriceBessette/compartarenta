# Design notes — housing plan proposal offer flow

## Transport and relay

- The relay exposes `POST /v1/envelopes`, `GET /v1/inbox/{recipient}`, and `POST /v1/envelopes/{id}/ack` with **opaque** `body_b64` per recipient (`docs/contacts-module-relay-payload.md`, relay schema `envelopes`).
- **Author-side “sent” status** can distinguish at minimum:
  - **Relay accepted** the POST (valid routing relationship, TTL clamped, row inserted for that recipient).
  - **Send failed** (network, 4xx/5xx, unknown) with a user-visible error per recipient where possible.
- **Recipient-side “delivered”** in the product sense means the client successfully **decrypted**, **validated**, and **persisted** the offer event; relay **ack** removes the ciphertext from the server queue and is orthogonal to “user has opened the UI”.
- Optional **app-level** read receipts or “fetched inbox” flags MAY be added in the encrypted payload for richer UX; they are not required for an MVP if the spec’s minimum bar is relay-accept + local persistence on pull.

## Proposal package

- Reuse the logical shape in `plan-contract-proposal-payload` (`expensePlanContractProposal` with `packageId`, `revisionId`, `contentHash`, embedded `plan` + `contract`).
- Wire encoding (new `kind` in the client frame vs reuse of an existing steady-state envelope) is an **implementation** choice subject to relay audit policy; the relay MUST remain unable to read plaintext.

## Serial response gate

- Fix a **response order** at offer creation time: all **recipients** (non-proposer participants in the plan roster) in a **stable order** documented in the spec (default: ascending housing participant `sortOrder`, then stable tie-break by participant id).
- The proposer does **not** occupy a slot in this order; the proposer’s intent is implicit in **creating** the revision (recorded as `proposed` / equivalent in history).
- While the offer is **open**, only the participant at the **head** of the queue who is still `pending` MAY submit a decision; others see **waiting** state. After that participant **Accepts**, the next pending participant becomes active. If they **Negotiate** or **Refuse**, the revision is **invalidated** for all remaining pending participants (see spec).

## Negotiate vs Refuse

- **Negotiate** and **Refuse** both invalidate the current revision for further responses; both SHOULD carry optional free text (Negotiate: encouraged; Refuse: optional per product).
- **Negotiate** signals intent to amend without necessarily supplying a full new package in the same message; any participant MAY start a **new** revision later (fork), including from the invalidated offer snapshot.

## History

- Every device retains an **append-only** (or monotonic) **event log** per `revisionId` (and cross-revision thread keyed by `packageId`) sufficient to render timeline and audits offline, including invalidation reasons and message text when present.
- **Fork** edges in the graph (`forkedFromRevisionId`, `forkedFromPackageId`) are part of the audit model so parallel revisions (Case #1) remain explainable after the fact.

## Concurrent offers and workbench

- **Per-revision serial gate** is unchanged: concurrency means **multiple revisions** in flight, each with its own queue—not one merged queue across packages.
- **Case #2** (two dwellings, same recipient B): two `packageId` values; B’s client lists two threads. **Final accept** and **send** are limited by the **Agreement period overlap gate** against B’s other participating plans—not by blanket withdrawal.
- **Case #1** (parallel forks): after `R1` invalidates, `R2` and `R3` are independent open revisions; recipients may see two **actionable** threads until each resolves.
- **Workbench selector** unifies navigation from home and authoring: draft row + per-offer rows; fork action is gated on **fork-eligibility** (not open).
- **Agreement period overlap gate** replaces a blanket “withdraw from a plan first” rule: comparison uses **calendar dates only** (no time-of-day, no UTC for this gate). **At most one shared day** between periods never blocks; **two or more** shared days block **send** / **final accept** until dates change.
